<p>Hi, I’m Béatrice (Bea), a Bilingual Project Manager with over 10 years of experience and author.</p>

<p>My goal is to take you from <b>A</b> to <b>Z</b>, simplifying complex projects so you can focus on what you do best --> growing your business.

<P>I focus on adding value to your business with a lean state of mind—keeping things simple, efficient & effective like a <b>BEE</b>.</p>

<p>Having recently moved from Toronto to enjoy better work-life balance, I want to focus on working with businesses with fewer than 500 employees. I love solving problems and bringing clarity to challenges, and I’m here to support your business as it grows and evolves.</p>
<p>What problem would you like to solve today?</p>


Let’s <b>PLAN</b>, <b>DO</b> , and get it <b>DONE!</b>
