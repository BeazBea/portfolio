<h2> What is it about?</h2>
<p> A term that defines the violation of personal space through unwanted hair interactions—sets the stage for this powerful and emotional journey of resilience, solidarity, and the fight against deeply ingrained social conditioning.
<br>
<br>
When Jasmine leaves the fast-paced life of the big city for the quiet streets of a small town, she quickly discovers that some challenges are universal. Misogyny, discrimination, harassment, and bullying lurk beneath the surface, ready to test her strength. 
<br>
<br>
But nothing prepares her for the unsettling reality of Hairlation—the unsolicited touching, pulling, and questioning of her hair, an invasion that speaks volumes about deeper societal issues.
<br>
<br>
This novel delves beyond individual encounters, exploring the lingering effects of postcolonial conditioning—the inherited beliefs, biases, and societal structures that continue to shape perceptions of identity and worth. Through social constructs, hair becomes more than just strands—it is a symbol of autonomy, cultural heritage, and resistance against imposed norms.<br><br>

As she grapples with these challenges, she finds unexpected strength in her community. Women who have endured violations come together, forming a network of support, advocacy, and empowerment. Together, they challenge the norms, dismantle outdated ideologies, and demand respect.<br><br>

Through vivid storytelling and raw emotion, Hairlation not only exposes the personal impact of racism and social conditioning but also highlights the collective struggle for dignity and justice. A testament to resilience and self-worth, Hairlation is a must-read for those who seek narratives of empowerment, social justice, and unbreakable spirit.</p>
